#Basic Concepts

###6.1.1 CPU-I/O Cycle

1. What is the objective of multiprogramming?
2. True/False. Process execution consists of a cycle of CPU execution and I/O wait.
3. Processes alternate between what 2 states?
4. An I/O bound program typically has many short what?
5. A CPU bound program might have a few long what?

###6.1.2 CPU Scheduler

6. What is a short-term scheduler?
7. True/False. The ready queue is always implemented as a first-in, first-out queue.
8. What other ways (if any) can a ready queue be implemented?

###6.1.3 Preemptive Scheduling

9. What 4 circumstances do CPU-scheduling decisions take place under?
10. What does nonpreemptive mean, in terms of a scheduling scheme?
11. What does preemptive mean, in terms of a scheduling scheme?
12. What can happen with preemptive scheduling when data is shared among several processes?
