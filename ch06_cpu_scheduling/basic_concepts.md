#Basic Concepts

###Objective of multiprogramming is to have some process running at all times, to maximize CPU utilization.

A process is executed until it has to wait, usually because of I/O requests. All this wait time is a waste of time for other processes that need to be executed. With multiprogramming, several processes are kept in memory at one time and when one process has to wait, the CPU is taken away and given to another process that is ready to run.
